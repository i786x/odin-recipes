    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (500 g) fingerling potatoes, halved (or Yukon golds or halved white/red baby potatoes)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper, divided </li>
        <li>4 (6 oz | 170 g) skinless salmon fillets</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 bunches asparagus, (18 spears, woody ends removed)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry white wine (substitute with 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth)</li>
        <li>1 lemon sliced to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 400°F | 200°C. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss together potatoes with the oil, 1/2 tablespoon of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread out in an even layer and roast for 15 minutes until they're just starting to soften and brown.</li>
        <li>Push potatoes to one side of the sheet pan and arrange salmon down the centre. Rub salmon evenly with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of parsley. Add the asparagus to the other side of the pan. </li>
        <li>Combine 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of the melted butter together and pour the mixture over the salmon and asparagus. Season everything with the remaining salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Return to oven and continue baking until the potatoes are golden and fork-tender and the salmon is opaque throughout, (about 10 minutes). Optional: broil in the last 2 minutes for charred edges. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining butter, garlic and lemon juice with the wine (or chicken stock). Serve with the salmon, veggies and lemon slices!</li>
    </ol>
